This quick program marks a google spreadsheet that conforms to these 
conventions:

+==================================================
|     |       | 1 | 2 | 3 ...
|     | <>    |a  |cd | d ...
|     | smith | a |dx | abc 
.
.
.

The Character string '<>' marks the answer row and the names column
The width of the attempts matrix is determined by the first empty answer cell
The height of the attempts matrix is determined by the last row with data.

So, it's possible to ad other cols or rows left or above the data. But not 
below it.  This would be easy to change.

The marking.py file is the business... rawData is just a tester, from Google.

You need a command like:

python marking.py --user='joan@gmail.com' --pw='somepass'
